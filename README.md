# Why was this script created?
#### Noticed that many commands had to be entered manually each time, which was very inconvenient, so I integrated them into a script for easier maintenance and viewing.
#### This is a very simplified system tool collection, currently in its initial version, convenient for personal use.
#### All features come from ChatGPT training results, with more common functions gradually added, environment for Debian 12 system.
